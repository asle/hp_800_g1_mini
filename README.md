## About mini-PCs and this machine
I am fascinated by these small, cute Mac Mini-like PCs and have had my hands on many different models from Lenovo, HP and Dell. You can get the first gen. models very cheap online (much cheaper than a slower Mac Mini) and they pack a lot of power considering their small size and price. They are all easy to upgrade with RAM, hard drives and CPU. That is not possible with a Mac Mini! What differs these machines are mainly:
* Different Intel gen. 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th etc.
* RAM speed and max capacity
* USB3 / USB-C and USB3 speeds
* Single or dual drive capacity 
* Heat and noise differences
___
The HP 800 G1 is the first gen. in this series. It features a Haswell low-power cpu, up to 16gb RAM and 2 drive slots, 1 x M.2 sata and 1 x 2.5".

## Pros HP 800 G1 
* The "T" cpu runs cool
* Easy to open (thumbscrew)
* Simple to swap to 3rd party wifi/bt card (the HP 800 G4 would not accept the same wifi/bt card)
* Can install 2 hard drives
* Easy to install 2.5" hard drive

## Cons HP 800 G1 
* The fan on this are a bit noisier than others I have tested even when temps are low
* The CPU heatsink must be removed to swap the M.2 drive. Thus new thermal paste must be applied
* The M.2 drive is NVMe but only SATA meaning not better speed than a 2.5" SSD.
